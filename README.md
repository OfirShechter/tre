# TRE
The code is based on the 'Measuring compositionality in representation learning' article (Andreas, J. (2019). arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.07181.) 

This method was modified in order to check the compositionality of RL agents languages (relevant repository: https://github.com/OfirShechter/NLPMultimodalGame). 

For further information, you are welcome to check the 'Compositionality Exploration' pdf attached.
